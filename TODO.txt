Bugs -
The keypoint matching video stream window stops updating when camera is facing a flat textureless surface
Solution-
1. Verify if it is keypoint detection or keypoint matching issue
Keep the camera facing textureless surface.
Start the processes
If you get ROS_ERROR saying "No keypoints found!!" then it got stuck at keypoint detection
If not then dig further down the code to keypoint matching

Image disply slowing down other core computations
Solution-
Create a seperate thread for display of imageSubscriber output
Create a seperate thread for display of feature detection output
Create a seperate thread for display of feature matching output

In FeatureDetector::detectFeatures(), keypoints.empty() line is redundant once intial set of images have matched
because the keypoints vector will never br empty after that since it is not cleared anywhere in the code.
Solution-

Verify that "keypoints1 = keypoints;" in FeatureMatcher::makePrevious() is correct without .clone()
