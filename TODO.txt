Bugs -
Image display slowing down other core computations
Solution-
Create a seperate thread for display of imageSubscriber output
Create a seperate thread for display of feature detection output
Create a seperate thread for display of feature matching output

In FeatureDetector::detectFeatures(), keypoints.empty() line is redundant once intial set of images have matched
because the keypoints vector will never br empty after that since it is not cleared anywhere in the code.
Solution-

Verify that "keypoints1 = keypoints;" in FeatureMatcher::makePrevious() is correct without .clone()

The keypoint detection video stream window stops updating when camera is facing a flat textureless surface
Solution-
Because no keypoint found on a flat textureless surface.
